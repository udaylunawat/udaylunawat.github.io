    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Developed an AI-powered X-ray screening system during the COVID-19 pandemic to address critical diagnostic bottlenecks in healthcare facilities. The system automatically classifies coronal chest X-rays into COVID-19 pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or normal lung conditions, providing rapid initial assessment to support medical professionals in crisis decision-making.
