    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Led the development of an intelligent multi-agent system built on Google ADK that revolutionizes data analysis by enabling natural language-driven insights. The framework enables users to ask questions in plain English and receive comprehensive analysis, visualizations, and actionable insights automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-Agent System Architecture:</strong> Designed and implemented specialized AI agents for data exploration, analysis, and visualization tasks using Google ADK orchestration platform</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Integrated Gemini 2.5-Flash model for advanced conversational analysis capabilities, enabling complex queries and context-aware responses</li>
        <li><strong>RAG Implementation:</strong> Architected dynamic data grounding system that prevents hallucinations and ensures accuracy in automated analysis responses</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization Engine:</strong> Built context-aware auto-visualization system that generates appropriate charts and graphs based on data characteristics and user context</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Integration:</strong> Implemented Vertex AI deployment pipelines with GCP-native security, compliance features, and A2A protocol for secure agent communication</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Engineered sub-second response times for complex analysis tasks while maintaining data accuracy and visual quality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Built conversational AI pipeline reducing analysis time by 90%</li>
        <li>Implemented multi-agent orchestration for specialized data tasks</li>
        <li>Developed auto-visualization system with context-aware chart generation</li>
        <li>Established RAG-based accuracy system preventing AI hallucinations</li>
        <li>Created production-grade deployment on Vertex AI with GCP security</li>
        <li>Enabled natural language queries for complex SQL-based analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Transformed enterprise data analysis from specialized coding requirements to accessible conversational interactions. Resulted in 90% reduction in analysis time, democratized data insights across non-technical stakeholders, and established new patterns for AI-powered business intelligence systems.
