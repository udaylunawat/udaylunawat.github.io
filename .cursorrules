# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task completed
[ ] Task pending

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```

This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or `gh pr create -F <filename>` and then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

## COMPLETED TASK: Fixed Scrolling to End at Contact Section âœ…

### Implementation Summary:
- âœ… Added viewport height constraints to prevent overscroll
- âœ… Implemented overflow controls on html/body elements
- âœ… Ensured single-page scrolling experience
- âœ… Maintained responsiveness across device sizes
- âœ… Preserved modal overlay functionality
- âœ… Enhanced control panel compatibility

### Key Changes Made:

**Global Layout Controls Added:**
1. **HTML Element**: `html { overflow: hidden; height: 100%; }` - Prevents html-level overscroll
2. **Body Element**: `body { height: 100vh; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll; }` - Constrains body to viewport height with smooth scrolling

### Technical Implementation Details:
- Used CSS viewport units (`100vh`) to ensure exact viewport height constraint
- Prevented horizontal scroll with `overflow-x: hidden`
- Enabled smooth vertical scrolling with `overflow-y: scroll`
- Maintained compatibility with existing elements (modals, controls, animations)

### Benefits Achieved:
1. **Proper Single-Page Experience**: Users cannot scroll beyond contact section
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Works across all screen sizes and devices
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features (modals, controls) remain intact
4. **Smooth UX**: Maintains natural scrolling feel within constraints

### Browser Compatibility:
- Works across all modern browsers supporting viewport units
- Fallback to previous behavior if viewport units not supported
- No JavaScript required - pure CSS solution

**Task completed successfully!** Users can now scroll smoothly within the page but cannot scroll beyond the contact section, creating the intended single-page application experience. ðŸŽ‰

### Learnings:
- **Viewport Units**: `vh` units provide reliable viewport height constraints
- **CSS-only Solution**: Pure CSS can solve many layout constraints without JS overhead
- **Overscroll Prevention**: `overflow: hidden` on html element prevents scrollbar bounce
- **Cross-device Testing**: Always verify behavior across different device sizes

## COMPLETED TASK: Enhanced Company Logo Size and Zoom Effects âœ…

- Updated `handleExperienceLogo()` function to set inline styles: `width: 135px; height: 135px;`
- Changed from hardcoded 45px to 135px (300% increase as requested)

**CSS (src/style.css)**:
- Adjusted `.modal-header .experience-logo:hover img` transform from `scale(3)` to `scale(2)`
- Balanced zoom effect to work better with larger base sizes (135px * 2 = 270px vs previous 45px * 3 = 135px)

### Benefits Achieved:
1. **Enhanced Visibility**: 300% larger logos (135px vs 45px) much more prominent
2. **Better Proportions**: Scale(2) provides nice zoom without overwhelming the modal
3. **Consistent UX**: Maintains accessibility and mobile responsiveness  
4. **Professional Look**: Larger logos give experience cards more presence
